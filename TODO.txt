1) SQL script genration updated and fixed few bugs 
2) Created UploadStagging.php file to upload and delete questions in bulk
3) You need to fix the image path in Q/A html body when creating body. 
4) The image path should be like wp-content/uploads/examdump/{examName}/imageName.jpg
5) For current exam this path is "wp-content/uploads/examdump/awsML/imageName.jpg". As of now all images are uploaded to server. If path is correct image must show in body.
